# Breakout Riddle Game Installations:

## MacOS 
####### Note: Unfortunately, M1 Macs are not currently supported. This is actively a work-in-progress.

1. Open **Terminal.app**
2. Copy/Paste the following command and press *return*:  
-     cd ~/Downloads/Breakout-Riddle-Game-main
3. Type '*make*' and press *return* to build the program. 
4. Wait for build to finish, then type '*make run*' and press *return* to run the executable. 

###### Note: Step 3 only needs to be performed once, as the program will remain built unless explicitly removed with 'make clean'
